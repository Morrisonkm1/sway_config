Sway Customizations

This repository houses my ongoing customizations for the Sway window manager. I've put this together as a safeguard in case of any mishaps with my Arch Linux OS and Sway setup. While these customizations are fairly basic for now, they serve as a foundation for future enhancements.

Contents:
Sway Config:
Functioning at a base level with essential shortcuts.
Requires further customization to tailor to my specific workflow.

Swaylock Config:
Work in progress but operational.
Additional visual enhancements are planned for a more polished appearance.

Sfwbar Config:
A project I've been developing, although visually incomplete.
Still refining to achieve the desired visual aesthetics and functionality.

Waybar Config:
Current Substitute for sfwbar because it seemed easier. I still currently have sfwbar running but it doesn't open on start. It only appears when it is called upon. Waybar has configuration files like volume, mic volume, internet connection, cpu degree (i think that's what it is), what language the keyboard is in, battery percentage, and date. It also contains color configuration which I don't want to do twice.

Progress Overview:

Sway Config:
Functioning smoothly with essential shortcuts.
Plans for customization underway to better suit my workflow.

Swaylock Config:
Operational with basic visual elements.
Enhancements planned to elevate its visual appeal.

Sfwbar Config:
Under development, yet to achieve visual cohesion.
Iterative refinement in progress to align with my design goals.


Overall, while these customizations are at a beginner level, they provide a solid foundation for future enhancements and personalization. Further refinements and additions are ongoing as I delve deeper into customizing my Sway environment.
